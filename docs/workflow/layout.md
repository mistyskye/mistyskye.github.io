## Window/panel management
Organising your workspace is important to be able to work efficiently. Remember to remove the default animation panel if you still have it!
- Right click the border between windows to Join Areas and click one the one you want to remove.

- Drag from corners between windows to create new windows.

- In most menus of the Properties panel, you can drag the top right of each subsection to reorder them.

## Custom layout
- You can save any render settings, layouts, tabs, properties so make sure to set it all up based on how frequently you change things.
- To save your current layout as the default startup, File > Defaults > Save Startup File > Save Startup File (click twice to confirm). 
- For example, I have added a Shapekeys tab with a specific window layout to streamline my shapekeys process.
