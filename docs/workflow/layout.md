## Custom layout
- You can save any render settings, layouts, tabs, properties so make sure to set it all up based on how frequently you change things.
- To save your current layout as the default startup, File > Defaults > Save Startup File > Save Startup File (click twice to confirm). 
- For example, I have added a Shapekeys tab with a specific window layout to streamline my shapekeys process.
