# Layout
{: .no_toc }

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

1. TOC
{:toc}

## Window/panel management
- Right click the border between windows to Join Areas and click one the one you want to remove.
- Drag from corners between windows to create new windows.
- In most menus of the Properties panel, you can drag the top right of each subsection to reorder them.

## Custom layout
- You can save any render settings, layouts, tabs, properties so make sure to set it all up based on how frequently you change things.
- For example, I have added a Shapekeys tab with a specific window layout to streamline my shapekeys process.
- To save your current layout as the default startup, File > Defaults > Save Startup File > Save Startup File (click twice to confirm).
