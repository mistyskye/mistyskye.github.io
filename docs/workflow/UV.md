## Settings up seams
This step is pretty manual since it requires you to thing of where you want your model to be cut. Make sure you're in Edge select mode (`2`), and don't forget to `Alt+Click` to select loops to work faster, then Right Click and `Mark Seam`.

## UV unpacking
Once you've set up your seams, go to the UV Editing tab for a better layout. Press `U` and click `Unwrap`. 
Depending on what you're unwrapping, you may want a specific layout to make painting easier. For example, I like to unwrap the head like this. 

Clothes or objects however can be unwrapped and packed using add-ons like [UVPackMaster]({% link docs/addons.md %}) to save time. 

Also, don't forget to make UVs into grids as often as possible, using [UVSquares]({% link docs/addons.md %}) for example! This will help future you when texture painting.
