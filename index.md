# Getting started

Welcome to my homepage! This website contains information I've gathered on making 3D VTuber models, from the add-ons I use to shortcuts I frequently rely on. Hopefully you will learn something!

The sidebar will help you navigate my "permanent" pages: these are condensed compilations and lists of information, tips and tricks. 

You will also find a blog-like page containing posts: these are more tutorial-oriented, and will guide you through certain sections of my workflow that I've optimised. You can find the list of these posts in the Tutorials page. They are also visible in the [Archive]({% link docs/tag.md %}), sorted by tags.

If you're anything like me, you see these awesome tutorials online and you take parts of them and integrate them into your workflow. Then, when you try to do it again one month later, you end up rewatching parts of various tutorials to try to patch back together what you did the first time. I ended up writing notes and getting lost in my pages of instructions for things I repeat, but not often enough to learn by heart. I also like having written notes so I can easily flip through to the part I've forgotten without having to find the video and rewatch it all. So here I've compiled it all, for me and for everyone else!
