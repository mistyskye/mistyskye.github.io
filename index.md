# Getting started

Welcome to my homepage! This website contains information I've gathered on making 3D VTuber models, from the add-ons I use to shortcuts I frequently rely on. Hopefully you will learn something!

The sidebar will help you navigate my "permanent" pages: these are compilations and lists of information, tips and tricks. 

You will also find a blog-like page containing posts: these are more tutorial-oriented, and will guide you through certain sections of my workflow that I've optimised. You can find the list of these posts in the Tutorials page.
